### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Krystyna Grzesiak, a PhD candidate in mathematics with a passion for statistics â€” and an even bigger passion for programming in R! ðŸ“ŠðŸ’»

Proud member of the [BioGenies](https://biogenies.info/) crew :genie: :genie: 

#### Projects

- I'm a huge fan of the Name That Tune! game â€” so much so that I built an app that lets you play it using Spotify! ðŸŽ¶ The app is live and ready to go. Want to give it a try? Just drop me a message with your Spotify email, and Iâ€™ll add you to the whitelist!
